# Firewall Script

WARNING
The BeamMP api that this script is using to lookup the account age of a player is currently broken! So account age checks fail with the error defined in MSG_PROFILE_HIDDEN


Will prevent players with a to young account and players that connect through a VPN/Proxy to join.
The Account age check and min age, just as the IP check can be toggled on/off.

If the IP or Account check fail for any reason, the script will let the player join. Simply because the ip-api or forum may not be available at times.
