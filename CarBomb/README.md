# CarBomb

### Motivation
Eh. Felt like it.

### What does it do?
Installs a auto bomb inside everyones car that is enabled whenever the player drives over X speed.
And that explodes the vehicle once the player drives below the same speed for > 3 seconds.

### Usage
- Type these either into the ingame chat or into the server console
- `/bomb` and `/bomb help` will show all available commands
- `/bomb enable` will enable the carbomb for everyone on the server or that may joins later
- `/bomb disable` disables
- `/bomb setspeed player_id speedinkph` sets the min speed the player has to drive

### Installation
- Put the `CarBomb.zip` into your servers `Resources/Client/` folder
- Put the entire `CarBomb` folder into your servers `Resources/Server` folder
- Open the `Resources/Server/CarBomb/main.lua` file in a text editor
- Add the player names to the ADMINS variable that you wish to have control over this script.
> eg `{"player_1", "player_2"}`
- Save file
- Run the Server and have fun (:
