# StreamersVsChat Addon (TrollThings)

This is a Addon to the [BeamMP-StreamersVsChat](https://github.com/SaltySnail/BeamMP-StreamersVsChat) Script by [SaltySnail](https://github.com/SaltySnail).

Replaces the Twitch integration from the original Script with a ingame chat and console interface controler to fire the individual commands.

### Usage
- Type these either into the ingame chat or into the server console
- `/troll` and `/troll help` will show all available commands
- `/troll hop` will launch all player vehicles on the server into the air
- `/troll hop player_id` will only launch the vehicles of this player into the air

### Installation
- Put the `StreamersVsChat.zip` into your servers `Resources/Client/` folder
- Put the entire `TrollThings` folder into your servers `Resources/Server` folder
- Open the `Resources/Server/TrollThings/main.lua` file in a text editor
- Add the player names to the ADMINS variable that you wish to have control over this script.
> eg `{"player_1", "player_2"}`
- Save file
- Run the Server and have fun (:
